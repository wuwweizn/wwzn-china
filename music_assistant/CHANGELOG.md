# [2.5.0] - 03.04.2025

## What‚Äôs Changed

### Server 2.5.0

Time for yet another great release. We've had a bit shorter beta cycle this time but still the release is packed with new providers, awesome new features and tons of bugfixes and small enhancements. 

My personal favorite of this release is the builtin player so you can take listen to your favorite tunes on the device you use to browse the webinterface. Subscribed to Home Assistant cloud and running the official Music Assistant add-on ? We have a treat for you: Using the builtin player will work (out of the box and completely secure) everywhere around the world! Oh and we now support recommendations on the homescreen (which is now also fully customizable btw).

A HUGE thank you for all contributors, beta testers, volunteers providing support and everyone else involved, you're all amazing!

Marcel

# [2.4.0] - 25.02.2025

## What‚Äôs Changed

The 2.4 release is packed with new features, new providers and loads a huge amount of bugfixes and all kind of improvements overall. 
Streaming should be better, smoother and more stable than ever!
Thanks to all contributors, beta testers and everyone else involved with this release!


**Some highlights:**

- Music Assistant now has native support for Podcasts and Audiobooks.

- Various new providers have been added to support podcasts and/or audiobooks.

- Existing providers that now have support for Audiobooks are Subsonic, YouTube and the local files provider. 

- Music Assistant now has a built-in, sophisticated DSP, which you can configure per player.

- Music Assistant now has native support for "external audio sources", which can be provided either by players themselves (source control) or by plugins. The first plugin to deliver this functionality is Spotify Connect.

- Music Assistant now has support for "Player Controls" which let you outsource e.g. the volume or power control for a player to a Home Assistant entity.


[And much, much more!](https://github.com/music-assistant/server/compare/2.3.6...2.4.0)


## ‚ö† Breaking Changes

In previous versions, Music Assistant always used a power control (on/off) for every player, even if a player does not even exist power control natively. Now, with the new "Player controls" feature this has become a user choice. If you like to get the old behavior back where you can power on/off every player, go into the player settings and assign "fake power" in the player controls section.


## üêõ Bugfixes

There have been countless bugfixes and (performance) improvements. Most important being that the streaming is now more robust to all kind of scenarios.

### Attention SONOS users

The Sonos provider has been rewritten from the ground up to support the new local, low latency API on Sonos speakers running the S2 firmware. If you have speakers running on S1 firmware, we have converted the old Sonos provider (with some tweaks and fixes) into the "Sonos S1" Provider. If your speakers are missing, make sure to uninstall the regular Sonos provider and install the S1 provider instead.

## [2.2.0] - 21.08.2024

2.2 release of Music Assistant Server !

### ATTENTION SPOTIFY USERS:
This release requires you (again) to re-authenticate but the good news is that we managed to get a full (official/recommended) PKCE login flow going for both library management and playback. Simple username and password is no longer possible due to the fact Spotify removed support for that.
